Start with 2 levels available in each world. Unlock other levels with items
Each world's fortresses are unlocked with items. Locks for each world are moved in front of the castle
Permanent cloud inventory item is given to skip over levels (so we keep the ability to reenter levels) OR ASM to allow moving over levels
Permanent warp whistle inventory item that takes you to a modified warp zone that allows you to warp to any world at any time
All levels are stripped of their powerups (except stars?). Instead, powerups are unlocked as permanent inventory items for each world
Access to all mushroom houses and spade bonuses for each world is given with a respective item
Mushroom houses have 1 check each so unlock is progression, spade bonuses are filler
The ability to swim requires the frog suit
?? The ability to run requires the first level of Progressive P-speed
The ability to fly requires the second level of Progressive P-speed and a flight suit
Some abilities could be randomized: P-switches, Progressive P-speed, Carry
All relevant levels will have coin checks, this is where having the powerups will be great for the randomizer.
    Some coins will be in the air and require flight
    Some coins will require hitting a p-switch
    Some coins will be replaced with ice coins to give purpose to the fire flower
    Some coins will be in or over water and require the frog suit
Memory Game is disabled
Mushroom houses, hammer bros, chest levels, giant mystery blocks, after world letters and warp whistle locations do not grant an item (but can be checks)
Hitting one-up blocks are checks?
White Mushroom Houses are disabled
